            I am a beginner level Javascript developer. If you are interested

          <h3>HTML5</h3>
          <p>
            I am very familiar HTML(Hyper Text Markup Language) as a web
            developer and use HTML for giving the structure to any website that
            I develop. This website was also built with the help of HTML5.

          <h3>CSS3</h3>
          <p>
            CSS which stands fro Cascading Style Sheets is a very core part of
            frontend develpment. CSS enables all the styling in a website and is
            a core skill to have for a web developer.

          <h3>Python</h3>
          <p>
            Python is a high-level beginner friendly language. It is a very
            crutial language when it comes to Machine Learning. If you are
            interested you can check out the Tic-Tac-Toe Game in python in the
            projects section.

            In this project I have developed a guess the number game in whic as
            the name suggests you have to guess the number generated on random
            which is between 1 to 20 and if you get it right you win the game.
            The interface will give you input if the correct number is higher or
            lower based on your guess if you didn't get the number from the get
            go. This projects is made by the use of <strong>HTML5</strong> ,
            <strong>CSS3</strong> and <strong>Javascript(ESP6)</strong>. If you

            In this project of mine I have developed the renowned game of
            Tic-Tac-Toe in the high-level programming language
            <strong> Python</strong>. I don't think I have to explain anything
            about this game as anyone who has went to school even once in their
            life knows this game by heart. You can play it by entering the
            numbers you wanna give your X or O as your chance comes on the

          <p class="projects-para">
            In this one I have built a Dice game which can be played by 2
            players in which whoever gets to 50 points on their main score first
            wins. You have to hold your score which you have on your rolling
            hand to add it to the main score. If you get a 1 you lose all the
            points on your rolling hand so make sure to hold the points in the
            main score before your luck runs out. In this project
            <strong>HTML5</strong> , <strong>CSS3</strong> and
            <strong>Javascript(ESP6)</strong> has been used. If you are
