            In this project I have developed a guess the number game in whic as
            the name suggests you have to guess the number generated on random
            which is between 1 to 20 and if you get it right you win the game.
            The interface will give you input if the correct number is higher or
            lower based on your guess if you didn't get the number from the get
            go. This projects is made by the use of <strong>HTML5</strong> ,

            In this one I have built a Dice game which can be played by 2
            players in which whoever gets to 50 points on their main score first
            wins. You have to hold your score which you have on your rolling
            hand to add it to the main score. If you get a 1 you lose all the
            points on your rolling hand so make sure to hold the points in the
            main score before your luck runs out. In this project
            <strong>HTML5</strong> , <strong>CSS3</strong> and
            <strong>Javascript(ESP6)</strong> has been used. If you are
